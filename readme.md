# SimplyMap

Wordpress plugin integrating Leaflet Maps. You can set markers, initial frame coords, zoom, frame size and
use shortcode to display map. 

### Install 
Zip "damirSimplyMap" folder and upload it as plugin into Wordpress.

### Notes
This is my first WP plugin so everything is all over the place - but it works and it's free!
